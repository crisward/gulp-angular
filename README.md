# Gulp Angular Recipe

This is bare skeleton of how I setup my Angular Apps.

Thought I'd put it here for future reference.


## How to use

```bash
git clone git@github.com:crisward/gulp-angular.git
cd gulp-angular
bower install
npm install
gulp
```
This will install everything needed. 
The gulp command starts watching your files for changes.

Open the index html in your browser. Install the chrome live reload widget and your 
browser will refresh while you code.

## What does it include

### Compilation for
* Stylus for css
* Coffeescript for js
* Jade for templates
* Debowerify to allow you to 'require' bower modules


### Included Libs

* Angular JS 1.3
* Bootstrap Stylus 3.2
